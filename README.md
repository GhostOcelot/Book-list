## Project configuration

In order to run the code on your local machine you'll need to get to the project folder and run 'npm install' to get the dependencies. Then 'npm start' will let you run the code on your local host and 'npm run build' will create a bundle in the dist folder that you can upload to your server and enjoy a live version of the project.
